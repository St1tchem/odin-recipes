        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a recipe for a super basic curry - better and cheaper than buying the sauce in jars. You can easily customise it to your preferences. Beef and green peppers is especially delicious. (When changing to a different protein you can add vegetable stock instead of chicken.</p>
