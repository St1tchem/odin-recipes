        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat together butter and sugars until fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add eggs one at a time and mix well between each.</li>
                <li>Add vanilla and mix to combine.</li>
                <li>Add all dry ingredients and mix until combined.</li>
                <li>Add all chocolate chips and mix until evenly distributed.</li>
                <li>Line 2 trays with baking paper and place 60-80g balls of cookie dough on the tray until you have used all the dough.</li>
                <li>Slightly squash the cookie dough balls and place the trays in the freezer to freeze the dough.</li>
                <li>To cook: Heat oven to 180 degrees or gas mark 4/5. Place cookies far apart on tray and bake for 15 mins.</li>
                <li>Cookies will be very soft when removed from the oven. Allow to cool on tray for at least 5 minutes. The cookies will finish cooking during this time.</li>
                <li>Eat cookies until you are a circle.</li>
